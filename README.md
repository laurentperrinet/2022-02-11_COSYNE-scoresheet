Following that message:

> Dear community, 

> COSYNE is a great conference which plays a pivotal role in our field. If you have submitted an abstract (or several) you have recently received your scores. I am not affiliated to COSYNE - yet willing to contribute in some way: I would like to ask one minute of your time to report the raw scores from your reviewers. I will summarize in a few lines the results in one week time (11/02). The more numerous your feedbacks the better their precision!

> Thanks!
